While adding new chips and pools to the miner, it's time to test it. Identify glitches and problems.

**System requirements:** windows x64 (win 7 and up)

The visual miner comes with a console mini miner. All algorithms except the necessary ones were cut out from the console and functions that are not used are removed - for full speed.

**There are 2 versions**: full and mini - they differ only in the presence of dll files that may be required. By default, download the mini version, if it swears at the missing dll files, then download the full one.

I**nstallation is simple**: download the archive.
